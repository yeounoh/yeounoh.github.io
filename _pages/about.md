Welcome! This is my new personal academic website, a space dedicated to exploring my ongoing research and thoughts on data systems, data-driven machine learning and intelligence.

I am currently at Google doing AI and data systems research. I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of engineering projects in data science and ML systems at both startups and large companies.
